#A Way to Notify Your Players

Creates a menu with a single button and up to 10 lines of text right before the main menu. It will disable itself once the button is pressed.

##How to use:
(Also found in the GUI if you haven't changed anything and launch)

1. Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/TehNut/LaunchGui/releases).
2. Open up the .jar and navigate to assets/launchgui/lang/en_US.lang
3. Open it up in your favorite text editor. Edit everything after the "=" on each line. Leave the line blank if you don't plan to use them, or want a line break.     
4. Distribute to your players in your pack.

I *do not* require any credit for this. It is fully open and useable by anybody.

##FAQ:

* __Oh no! I found a bug/leak with it! D:__
   
   Please feel free to make a PR with a fix or open an issue on GitHub.

* __Can you include X feature?__
   
   No. It won't be anything more than a GUI that opens on launch. I may change how I do the text, but otherwise no.

* __Why should I use this?__
   
  Sometimes you need to let your players know something on first launch.

* __Can you port to Minecraft 1.X.X?__ 
   
   Sure, why not. Just ask me.

* __Why did you make this?__

   Somebody came to the TPPI IRC channel and asked how we did it as they needed it for another pack. Since it was done with TPPITweaks, I offered to create a mod for them that did it.
